*When Cosmoose is not releasing, I like to have good music to get in the flow. To do that, I need to have a wide horizon of genres and moods to fit my particular state.*

As I always say, music is simply the sweetest brain endofunctor.
But there is an astronomical number of good albums out there, dozens, conceivably hundreds. You can check on Cosmotify and Coscamp for yourself, it will shock you for sure.

So to avoid getting lost in all these references, I made this small guide to discover all the different facets of music, carefully curated by myself, just for you, for free!
