<p>
  The first Cosmoose game, CC's Road to Stardom, is here!
  This is meant as an introduction to text adventures.
  This is a small, heartwarming story you can play with your kids.
</p>

<p>
  It's CC's birthday! 
  Will he be gifted his dream, to become the universe's biggest idol? 
  He's the cutest creature in the universe after all, so it would only be fair. 
  If he doesn't, all his friends from the Cosmoose Gang can help him. Maybe?
