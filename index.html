    Welcome to the universe of Cosmoose!
    Starting from an Experimental Pop music experience with musicians from all over the world, Cosmoose has evolved into a story and visual universe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our second album just released! The next big project is to make a remix album out of it, like was done for the first album.
