A genius programmer/hacker.
Values friendship above everything, and wants to love everybody.

Florrie tends to believe anything from any source, and it sometimes puts her in trouble without realising it.
Very curious, she can disappear for days and put herself in danger, so the crew often needs to watch over her.
For some reason, The Government is hunting her desperately.
