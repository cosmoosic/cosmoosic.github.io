A skilled and mysterious mechanic, always wearing a lion helmet full of secret tools (nobody knows whatâ€™s inside).

Wool is serious and reliable, and understands very quickly all of the technical aspects of any situation.
Even though he will never admit it to anyone, one of his main ambitions is to master social media marketing using his scientific expertise.
He thinks everything has a logical explanation, including all of The Government's secrets.
Makes a great partnership with Ru D. when the latter is not lazing around.
