An AI core the Cosmoose crew ran into while running from the Government. Very knowledgeable, but not very wise. She still has a lot to learn about the world.

Seven Seas (7Cs, or her full name CCC3CRC3C2C) seems to be on our side, and she helps us a lot by sharing all her historical, biological and psychological knowledge. But, isnâ€™t it a little strange to be working together with an AI that was created by the Government? Can we trust her?
